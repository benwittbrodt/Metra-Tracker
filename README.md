# Setup
Ensure that you have credentials for the METRA API which can be applied for here:  https://metra.com/developers and should only take a day or so to get.

You'll receive a text file with the username (u:) and passowrd (p:)

## Lines
This integration works throughout the METRA network so pick which line you are wanting to track 

## Start and End stops 
These lists are in alphabetical order 

# Sensors
The integration will create 3 sensors once configured. Each sensor is numbered related to the sequence of arrival into the chosen departure station, 1-3. 

Sensor 1 is always the next train to arrive. Once that trian departs the chosen departure station the arrival time from sensor 2 becomes that of sensor 1 and 3 to 2 etc.

The sensor state will be the time of arrival for the intitial (departure) station and the arrival time at the destination station. 
    
- Formatted as such for each view on a entity card: 22:30 â†’ 22:49
